# JXMLValidator

JXML Validator provides an easy command line and GUI interface for validating XML files to all schemas defined in the document.

This is really useful if you have very complicated XML and simply want to check if its valid or not, as is often the case with [OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) Web Services.

Code is available under the GPLv2 Licence from [github](https://github.com/GeoffWilliams/JXMLValidator)
