# 52North SOS

While on assignment for the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Canberra, I was responsible for drastically improving the efficiency of the [52North.org](http://52north.org/) [SOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_Observation_Service) server.

Due to the amount of changes this work generated, the 52north.org team agreed that the best approach to publishing it was to make a [new release -- v3.6](http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/codeRepository.html).

My work on this project was carried out in consultation with 52north.org via email, conference calls and in-person at [FOSS4G 2013](http://2013.foss4g.org/) where I gave the attached presentation to 52north staff in an informal discussion.
